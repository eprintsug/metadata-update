# Metadata Update

This script can update an item with bibliographic metadata found using the item's DOI or 
PubMed ID. The tool can either update, overwrite or just report on differences found.

The original script is available on http://files.eprints.org/744/ 

The version provided here was updated to cope with the https protocol that the NCBI uses 
for its APIs and with the new Crossref API URL.

Developed by Peter West on behalf of University of Zurich, Switzerland who have 
contributed this development to the E-Prints Community.

## Requirements

Requires the PubMedXML and DOI import plugins delivered in the EPrints distribution.
